## Discussion of problems, errors, miscalculations, and missteps and how you overcame them

Our first big roadblock was designing a valve that would fit all of our needs.  We came up with a bunch of individual valve ideas that used different methods of holding the air inside of the balloon, but a lot of them we found flaws that would make them impossible for us to set it up, unable to retain the helium, or they couldn't reseal after we release an amount of air (Which was a requirement for them to be usable for us). 

The big overarching problem with our whole porject was that there was a severe weight limit since a helium balloon can only lift a tiny amount of weight. because of this problem we got larger balloons so that they could lift more, while at the same time we minimized the additional weight added by the unessential peices of our project. after making everything as small as possible we still discovered we would need an extra balloon to be able to lift our payload. This also brought another problem, when we reduced the materials we made everything as thin as was prudent and this caused our wall and supports to be thin, flexible, and weak. This meant some of our peices immeadiatly snapped off before we even got our hands on the actual 3D print. The way we overcame this was by thickening points that were especially weak, adding ribbing accross the roof where the rubber bands were adding strain, and making more secure backup features to the box that would function to keep everything together in case peices of our box failed.
