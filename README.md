Our first big roadblock was designing a valve that would fit all of our needs.  We came up with a bunch of individual valve ideas that used different methods of holding the air inside of the balloon, but a lot of them we found flaws that would make them impossible for us to set it up, unable to retain the helium, or they couldn't reseal after we release an amount of air (Which was a requirement for them to be usable for us).
