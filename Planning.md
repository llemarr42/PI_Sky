# Options for project:

## Balloon

### requirements / description

A balloon filled with helium that is carrying a payload.

The balloon should be able to carry the weight of said payload and be able to rise. Once at a certain height, the Pi will do some action to begin descent (pop balloon, slowly let air out of balloon, separate Pi from balloon). The Pi will be collecting data on acceleration and position for the duration of the flight. Additionally, the Pi might take photos or collect data on temperature, humidity, or other undetermined variables. 

### Materials:

* Pi

* accelerometer

* balloon

* helium

* Pi camera

* Capsule / shell


### pros
* Easy to launch/simple flight mechanisms
* Good for taking photos because the camera can be mounted in the same direction for the duration of the flight
* Long flight time means more time to collect data (as opposed to a rocket or the like)

### cons
How are we getting helium?

### other things to consider
* We have to have a very reliable system of descent, otherwise we will lose the Pi
* If the system of descent involves destroying or losing the balloon, we will have to buy a LOT of balloons
* Every descent will also cost helium of which we will have a limited supply

## Monocopter

### requirements / description

This project should use a single central propeller to lift the project in a vertical direction. 

The motor that controls the blade needs to have enough lifting force to be able to cause the project to have the ability to fly up to a certain height then once reaching that height, the blades will slow to a speed that in which the project remains in place save for drifting horizontally then after x amount of time the blades will further slow as to make the project descend in a controlled manner. During this process the pi will be taking photos and recording specific data that is yet to be determined.

### Materials
* A High quality motor that is good for what we need… (lightweight, small, but powerful)
* Pi
* Accelerometer 
* 3D print material / wood (depending on project design)
* Pi camera
* Equipment for measuring data


### pros
* This project is in a class by itself and majestic (thanks to thesaurus.com)
* Challenging but plausible
* We will have more control of where this goes, when it goes back down, and how fast this goes (depending on what type of monocopter) 
### cons
* Not sure how it would work/if it is realistically feasible
* If we choose this we will risk not being able to complete the project by the due date
* We will only have one attempt for printing and stuff as it will be too big to reprint it or change things after the fact (wood will lessen this problem)
 
## slingshot launch, fancy landing

### requirements / description

Use one of the slingshots used for the eggdrop project to launch a pi, which could:

Take a picture when it is facing the ground
Graph the path of its flight

### Materials

* Capsule
* Pi
* Accelerometer
* Slingshot 

### pros

* Less complicated launch, more able to focus on what it does in air
* No outside materials needed for launch

### cons

* Needs to be very compact and self-contained
* Would reach lesser altitudes compared to other projects
* The need for it being self-contained could cause complications in the landing process
